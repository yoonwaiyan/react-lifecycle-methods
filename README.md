# React Lifecycle Methods

This is a demo to show the difference between the new lifecycle methods introduced since React 16.3.2 and the legacy lifecycle methods which is deprecated and will be removed soon.
This is inspired by the original diagram provided by [Dan Abramov in his tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509), and I've made another similar diagram for older versions of React to make it easier to compare as
a reference for migration.

This repo is available in CodeSandbox while the website is available [here](https://yoonwaiyan.github.io/react-lifecycle-methods/).
